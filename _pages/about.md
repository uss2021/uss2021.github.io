AI Helps Ukraine is a charity conference organised for raising funds to support Ukrainian oncological hospitals and non-profit organisations. The ongoing war dramatically affects the accessibility to essential supplies and medicines for cancer treatment in Ukraine. As AI researchers, we believe that collective efforts of our broad international community can make a real difference for those who are in need and save lives. Therefore, we are bringing together brilliant artificial intelligence experts, an empathetic audience and responsible companies to attract attention and collect money for oncological patients in Ukraine.

Our mission is to bring the AI community together and get the money on the table needed for humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Sometimes tech and AI can help most effectively with financial means and material resources. In the case of providing access to cancer treatments, this means that we are looking for the following donations: Money, medicines, and equipment. Whatever medicine and equipment we cannot get directly will be bought with the donations.

### Territorial acknowledgement

We, the organisers, acknowledge that the lands and waters where most of us live and where our universities are located---[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/indigenouspeoples/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/circ/land-acknowledgement) and [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html)---are the traditional and unceded territories of Indigenous peoples. The Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) Nation call Tiohtiá:ke the site commonly known as Montréal. Since long before the arrival of European settlers, this territory has been and continues to be a gathering place for many Indigenous peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within our communities.
