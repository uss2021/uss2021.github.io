## When

Starting in November, stay tuned!

### Virtual conference

November 2022: A series of online talks by [renowned scientists](./speakers) in the area of AI for good.

### Conference at Mila in Montreal

December 8th 2022: A full-day in-person conference on AI for good at [Mila Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) in Montreal.

## Why

One of the sorrowful aftermaths of the war that broke out in Ukraine in early 2022 is the scarcity of drug supplies for cancer patients in the country. After knowing that a friend of us had to leave the country due to difficulty to obtain cancer treatment,  we decided to organize an event to raise funds to help cover some of the needed drugs. We contacted the National Institute of Research for Cancer of Ukraine, which sent us a list of needed supplies and, greatly aware of the dire situation.

As AI researchers, we believe that collective efforts of our broad international community can make a real difference for those who are in need and save lives. Therefore, we are bringing together brilliant and committed AI experts, an empathetic audience and responsible companies to collectivelly support oncological patients in Ukraine.

## How

### How do we know which are cancer drugs and equipment needs in Ukraine?

The [National Institute of Research for Cancer of Ukraine](https://www.uicc.org/membership/national-cancer-institute-kiev-ukraine) and other organizations that we know first hand and that have great needs in order to treat their cancer patients have sent us a list of the drugs needed in Ukraine.

### How will we send drugs and equipment?

We have created a partnership with Ukraine Medical Support([UAMS](https://uams.ca/)), a Toronto-based NGO whose mission is to provide medical and psychological help to vunerable people in Ukraine. UAMS will support us during the logistics and shipment process. We have access to a warehouse in Canada and in Ukraine, and we are in contact with small organizations inside Ukraine to pick up the material and do the shipments.

### How can you get involved?

We are looking for the following donations: money, drugs and equipment. 

To make it easier, we will soon post a list with different things needed in Ukraine, according to lists sent by the National Cancer Institute of Ukraine and other centers.

We encourage tech and pharma companies, as well as individuals, to donate whatever they can (money or drugs) to make this possible.

## Who

We are a group of early-career AI researchers, very aware of the situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, we know first hand the difficulties to access cancer treatment in the country, and we want to do our bit by organizing this charity conference. You can read more about us in the [Team](./team) page. You are very welcome to [get in touch!](#contact).
